# WebRTC â€“ Cheat Sheet

Exchange real-time audio, video and data with one or more peers entirely in the browser.

> Imagine a world where your phone, TV, and computer could communicate on a common platform. Imagine it was easy to add video chat and peer-to-peer data sharing to your web app. That's the vision of WebRTC.

| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| STUN | "Session Traversal Utilities for NAT" is server which is used to get your device IP address                               |
| TURN | "Traversal using Relay NAT" is server which is used as fallback when peer-to-peer connection fails                        |
| SDP  | "Session Description Protocol" Contain info about the session connection such as the codec, media type, audio, video, etc |
| ICE  | "Interactive Connectivity Establishment" helps clients coordinates discovery them publicly                                |

## RTCPeerConnection

The RTCPeerConnection interface represents a WebRTC connection between the local computer and a remote peer. It provides methods to connect to a remote peer, maintain and monitor the connection, and close the connection once it's no longer needed.

| [icecandidate](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/icecandidate_event)                   | Fires when ICE candidate is added to local peer      |
| [datachannel](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/datachannel_event)                     | Fires when data channel is added to the connection   |

### Properties

| Name                                                                                                  | Description                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| [connectionState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/connectionState) | Indicates the current state of the peer connection |

## RTCDataChannel

The RTCDataChannel interface represents a network channel that can be used for bidirectional peer-to-peer transfers of arbitrary data. Every data channel is associated with an RTCPeerConnection, and each peer connection can have up to a theoretical maximum of 65,534 data channels (the actual limit may vary from browser to browser).
